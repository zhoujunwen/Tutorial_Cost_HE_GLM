# Tutorial_HE_Cost_GLM

A Tutorial on Estimating Costs Associated Discrete Model State using Generalized Linear Model with R

This folder contains all the R codes from a tutorial paper illustrating how to estimate costs associated with disease model state using the generalized linear model (GLM) framework.
People should read the relevant publication (https://doi.org/10.1007/s40273-023-01319-x). To run the illustartive codes, you need to download all the r scripts in a specific folder,
follow the instruction from the r script and run the script one by one.
